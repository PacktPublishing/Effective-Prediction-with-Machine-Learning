# Effective Prediction with Machine Learning - Second Edition [Video]
This is the code repository for [Effective Prediction with Machine Learning - Second Edition [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/effective-prediction-machine-learning-second-edition-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789132793), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Deep learning is the next big thing. Itâ€™s a part of machine learning. Its favorable results in applications with huge and complex data is remarkable. R programming language is very popular among data miners and statisticians. 
Scikit-learn has evolved as a robust library for machine learning applications in Python with support for a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
This course begins by taking you through videos on evaluating the statistical properties of data and generating synthetic data for machine learning modeling. As you progress through the sections, you will come across videos that will teach you to implement techniques such as data pre-processing, linear regression, logistic regression, and K-NN. You will also look at Pre-Model and Pre-Processing workflows, to help you choose the right models. Finally, you'll explore dimensionality reduction with various parameters.
